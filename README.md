## about ML_clssifier

A machine learning classifier is a fundamental component of the field of machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence. ML classifiers are algorithms that learn to recognize patterns and make predictions based on labeled training data. They are widely used for tasks like image recognition, sentiment analysis, spam detection, medical diagnosis, and many other applications where data needs to be classified into different categories or classes.


Definition: An ML classifier is an algorithm that learns from labeled data to make predictions or categorize new, unseen data.

Applications: ML classifiers are used for various tasks such as image recognition, sentiment analysis, spam detection, medical diagnosis, and more.

Common Classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors are some common types of ML classifiers.

Supervised Learning: Most ML classifiers belong to the supervised learning category, where they learn from labeled data.

Training and Testing: During training, the classifier learns from the labeled data, while during testing, it predicts on unseen data to evaluate its performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Performance is measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Hyperparameter Tuning: ML classifiers often have hyperparameters that need to be optimized to achieve the best performance.

Feature Extraction: Before training the classifier, relevant features are extracted from raw data or transformed into a suitable format.

Deep Learning Classifiers: Neural networks, such as CNNs and RNNs, are widely used for complex tasks in image recognition and natural language processing.

Overfitting and Regularization: Techniques like regularization are used to prevent overfitting, where the classifier performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

Impact: ML classifiers have revolutionized problem-solving in various domains and continue to advance with the growth of data and computing resources.



## Overview

This project explores the performance of various machine learning classifiers on a dataset. The main objective is to compare different classifiers and identify the best model for the given classification task. The classifiers used in this project include Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Also Shows a graph to show a clear comparision between different Classifiers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is "adult.csv." It contains information about individuals, including features such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, and income.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version x.x)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
